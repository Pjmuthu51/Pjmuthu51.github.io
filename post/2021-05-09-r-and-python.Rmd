Over the course of the semester, we have explored various different aspects of R including wrangling in [project 1](/project/project1/) and modeling in [project 2](/project/project2/) . Recently, we began to talk about python and its interactions with R. 


Python is a general software development programming language that has evolved over time to included packages that allow it to do things that many other languages focus on like data science with R and website design with HTML.

R on the other hand focuses on data science and statistical modeling.

As we can see here, Python can do simple math.

```{python}
print(1+1)
```

So can R!

```{R}
1+1
```

Through the Reticulate package, we are able to communicate between R and python, transferring data seamlessly. 


```{python}
import pandas
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[flights['dest']== "ORD"]
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights = flights.dropna()
```

This imports a dataset using python and manipulates it. We can then use R to graph the data.

```{R}
ggplot(py$flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()
```
Overall, both python and R have their individual benefits, but using packages like reticulate can help bring both together!
